        <!-- I was able to resize the large image in terminal using
            sips -Z 640 *.jpg
            Im guessing that * means any, so if I labeled a specific one
            it would resize that too. Will test out later-->

<h2>   
    Ingredients
</h2>

<p>
    1. 8 oz macaroni (Rao's is my favorite)
</p>
<p>
    2. Coarse kosher salt
</p>
<p>
    3. 20 oz ml milk
</p>
<p>
    4. 8 oz melting cheese (4 oz gruyere, 4 oz mild cheddar)
</p>


<h2>   
    Method:
</h2>
    </p>1.Add the macaroni and milk to a saucepan or fry pan with a sprinkle of salt. Turn the heat to medium-high. While stirring, bring the milk to a boil and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the pasta cook while stirring until just al dente and the milk has reduced to a cream-like consistency. About 15 minutes. Note: If the pasta is not done, but the milk has reduced, add in a little more milk until the pasta is cooked.
    </p>
<p>
    2. Turn the heat to low, add in your selection of melting cheeses and stir until the cheese melts and the sauce has formed about 1-2 minutes. Taste it. Season with salt if needed and serve.
</p>
<p>
    3. To reheat leftover mac and cheese. Add to a bowl and add 1 TBSP of milk per cup of mac & cheese. Heat in the microwave for 45-60 seconds and stir until the creamy again.
